# GlobeTalk ‚Äî Virtual Pen Pals üåç‚úâÔ∏è

**GlobeTalk** is a privacy-first, anonymous pen-pal platform that connects people around the world for friendly, cultural, asynchronous ‚Äúletter‚Äù exchanges. It recreates the charm of postal pen pals using modern web tech: random matchmaking, delayed message delivery, short cultural profiles, and moderation ‚Äî text-only and anonymous by design.

## Quick summary
- **Purpose:** Help users make anonymous, cross-cultural connections via delayed text letters.  
- **Key constraints:** Text-only (no file/media), anonymous (no names/emails published), moderation/reporting, OAuth-based sign-in for account protection.  
- **Target users:** Curious learners,language learners, students, and anyone seeking low-pressure cultural exchange.

## Team member roles
- **Product Owner & Client:**Nathan (Responsible for defining the product vision and prioritizing features.)
- **Scrum Master:**Diana (Facilitates the Scrum process, leads meetings, and ensures the team stays on track.)
- **Team:**The group of individuals who develop, test, and support the product, include:
    - Keevon Jacobs
    - Makomane Tau

## Project Management Methodology

- We have chosen **Agile Scrum** as our project management methodology. Scrum is an iterative and collaborative framework that divides the project into short, manageable cycles called sprints. Each sprint produces an incremental release, allowing us to continuously improve the product, respond to feedback, and adapt to changing requirements throughout the development process.

- **Three Key Artifacts in Scrum**
    - Product Backlog: A comprehensive list of all desired features and requirements for the product, including items planned for future sprints.
    - Sprint Backlog: A prioritized list of features and tasks selected from the product backlog for completion during the current sprint.
    - Burn Down Chart: A visual representation of progress, showing how much work remains in the sprint backlog over time.

- **Three Main Ceremonies**
    - Sprint Planning: All team members meet to discuss user stories, define sprint goals, and estimate the effort required for each task.
    - Weekly Scrum (Daily Stand-up): Team members briefly share what they have completed, what they are currently working on, and any obstacles they are facing
    - Sprint Review / Retrospective: Held at the end of each sprint. The team demonstrates progress to the client and reflects on what went well and what can be improved in future sprints.

## Features
- **Random Matchmaking** ‚Äî pair users globally with optional filters (language, region/time-zone).  
- **Asynchronous Messaging** ‚Äî write a ‚Äúletter‚Äù, schedule a delivery delay (e.g., 12 hours).  
- **Cultural Profiles** ‚Äî short, anonymous fields (age range, hobbies, region, languages).  
- **Inbox / Compose** ‚Äî thread-based UI for reading and writing letters.  
- **Moderation** ‚Äî reporting, moderation logs, blocking.  
- **Settings & Safety** ‚Äî block/report, toggle match preferences, delete account.

**Summary:**  
GlobeTalk uses a modular architecture with a Next.js frontend, a backend API for matchmaking and messaging, a NoSQL database for storing users, profiles, matches, and messages, and a worker/scheduler for delayed message delivery. The data model is privacy-focused, with anonymous IDs and moderation logs to ensure safety.

- **Jest** for unit and integration tests  
- **Testing Library** for React component tests  
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD  
- **Codecov** for code coverage reporting
