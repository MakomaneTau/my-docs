## Quick summary
- **Purpose:** Help users make anonymous, cross-cultural connections via delayed text letters.  
- **Key constraints:** Text-only (no file/media), anonymous (no names/emails published), moderation/reporting, OAuth-based sign-in for account protection.  
- **Target users:** Curious learners, language learners, students, and anyone seeking low-pressure cultural exchange.

## Features
- **Random Matchmaking** ‚Äî pair users globally with optional filters (language, region/time-zone).  
- **Asynchronous Messaging** ‚Äî write a ‚Äúletter‚Äù, schedule a delivery delay (e.g., 12 hours).  
- **Cultural Profiles** ‚Äî short, anonymous fields (age range, hobbies, region, languages).  
- **Inbox / Compose** ‚Äî thread-based UI for reading and writing letters.  
- **Moderation** ‚Äî reporting, moderation logs, blocking.  
- **Settings & Safety** ‚Äî block/report, toggle match preferences, delete account.

## Tech stack

### Frontend

#### Nextjs

Youtube reference:
Why next.js over react - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msJicleNHkA

* Routing - Next.js provides a built-in file-based routing system that automatically
maps files in the pages directory to URLs, making navigation intuitive without extra
configuration.
* Code-Splitting ‚Äì It automatically splits JavaScript by page, so users only download
the code needed for the page they‚Äôre viewing, improving load times.
* Pre-Rendering ‚Äì Next.js can generate HTML for each page at build time (SSG) or on
request (SSR), boosting SEO and performance compared to client-side rendering.
* API Support ‚Äì It allows you to create serverless API routes directly in the same
project, removing the need for a separate backend for simple server-side logic

#### Tailwind CSS
Youtube reference:
Why tailwind css - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKrPeUQiDu4

* Customization ‚Äì It‚Äôs highly configurable via a single config file, allowing you to
define colors, spacing, typography, and breakpoints to match your design system
* Utility-First Styling ‚Äì Tailwind offers a wide range of low-level utility classes that let
you style elements directly in your markup without writing separate CSS files.
* Responsive Design ‚Äì Built-in responsive variants make it easy to create designs
that adapt seamlessly across different screen sizes
* Performance ‚Äì Tailwind automatically purges unused CSS in production, keeping
file sizes small and load times fast.




### Backend

#### Firebase

* Authentication ‚Äì Firebase Authentication provides ready-to-use sign-in methods
(email, password, social logins) with secure session management, reducing the
need to build auth from scratch.
* Cloud Firestore ‚Äì A scalable NoSQL database that syncs data in real-time across
clients, making it ideal for dynamic and collaborative apps.

#### Express.js

* Minimal and Flexible ‚Äì Express provides a lightweight core with the flexibility to add
only the middleware and features you need.
* Routing ‚Äì Offers a simple yet powerful routing system to handle different HTTP
methods and URL patterns.
* Middleware Support ‚Äì Easily integrates third-party or custom middleware to handle
requests, responses, authentication, and more.
* REST API Development ‚Äì Well-suited for building robust and scalable RESTful APIs
quickly with minimal boilerplate.


### Deployment

#### Netlify
* Continuous Deployment ‚Äì Automatically builds and deploys your site whenever
you push changes to your Git repository.
* Global CDN ‚Äì Delivers your site through a fast, globally distributed content
delivery network for low-latency access worldwide
* Serverless Functions ‚Äì Allows you to run backend logic without maintaining a
server, ideal for lightweight APIs and dynamic features.
* Instant Rollbacks ‚Äì Lets you revert to any previous deploy instantly, ensuring
quick recovery from issues.
